Portfolio summision 

•	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a game developer with a current game on the mobile platform of Android. They desire to port their current game “Draw it Or Lose It” from Android to other platforms; their focus is Mac, Linux, Windows, and mobile devices. Their project requirements are that the game runs as a web-based app that is cross-platform. Their software requirements are that only a single instance of the game exists at the same time, many named teams can be created, the keeps track of individual player ids and points, and the game renders images form a library at a consistent rate.
•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I research the subject of game development and porting in detail. Industry practices both on triple AAA and indie development. The security measures developers use to maintain their servers and prevent client-servers from being manipulated. Solutions for cross platform interface, and finally the benefits of closed vs open-sourced tools.

•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through the design document allowed me to get familiar with requirements for the app which in turn made writing the code easier. At the very least I need to start when making new classes and the possible solutions to the issues in the other classes.

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would like to revise server by platform. I think my bias against Mac and Android made me dismiss them too quickly as worthless in game development.

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user’s need are essential when developing for a client so naturally they were my main target to please when devising “recommendation.” With practicality in mind, I worked on meeting user needs. The realities of game development dictate that implementation ultimately lies on the amount of time and resources a team possesses so I did consider limiting my ideas to the most cost-effective solutions.

•	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Well, after working on the start-up basics such as analyzing the basic outline of the project the next step is identifying the goal or issue. After that planning or a rough idea on the design’s properties and resources needed for completion. Next choosing my tools and methods for the software. Then creating a design patter or pseudocode to shape raw ideas and structure. Systematically construct my project based on my patters, test for issues at the same time. Test my first design and look for areas that require improvement or have errors. Clean my work and edict down any unnecessary work notes or quirks from my design.
